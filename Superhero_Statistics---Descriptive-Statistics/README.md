### Project Overview

 Superhero Statistics

The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. We have with us the data of more than 500 super humans but we need your knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it.

The dataset has details of 594 super hero characters with the  17 features.
