### Project Overview

 ## **Problem Statement**

Using Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.

For this project we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back

The data that we have is from 2007-2010.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I now have a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model. In this project, I have applied the following concepts.

- **Train-test split**
- **Correlation between the features**
- **Decision Tree Modeling**
- **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Graphviz**


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - **Data loading** - The first task is 'surprise' loading the data and see how it looks. Also drop certain columns and split the data for further tasks.
- **Target variable distribution** -   Plot a bar graph of Target Variable.
- **Feature Split** -  In this task along with one step of feature engineering, splitting the features based on the data type for visualization purposes.
- **Numerical Features Visualisation** -  Ploting the relation of numerical features with the target variable.
- **Categorical Features Visualisation** -  Plotting the relation of categorical features with the target variable.
- **Model Building**  - Part of decision tree modeling and finding accuracy of model
- **Decision Tree Pruning** - Pruning of decision tree to check if improves its accuracy. Used grid search to do the optimum pruning
-  **Tree visualising** -  Pruned decision tree visualisation
